The "mlruns" folder is created by MLflow to store the artifacts and tracking information related to your MLflow experiments. This folder is used to organize and store the results, parameters, metrics, and models generated during your MLflow runs.

Inside the "mlruns" folder, you'll typically find subdirectories for each MLflow run you've executed. These subdirectories contain information and artifacts related to each specific run, making it easy to track and compare different experiments.

Here's a brief overview of what you might find inside the "mlruns" folder:

1. **mlruns/:** The main directory where all experiment runs are stored.

2. **mlruns/0/:** Subdirectories corresponding to different runs. The "0" here represents the first run, and you'll see more subdirectories if you run the code multiple times.

3. **mlruns/0/meta.yaml:** Metadata about the experiment run, such as start time, end time, and user information.

4. **mlruns/0/params/:** Contains parameter values logged using `mlflow.log_params()`.

5. **mlruns/0/metrics/:** Contains metric values logged using `mlflow.log_metrics()`.

6. **mlruns/0/artifacts/:** Contains artifacts logged using `mlflow.log_artifact()`. In your code, you didn't log any artifacts, but you can use this to store files or additional information related to your experiments.

7. **mlruns/0/model/:** Contains the trained model saved with `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`.

The structure and contents of the "mlruns" folder will vary depending on how you configure and run your experiments with MLflow. It's a convenient way to keep track of different runs and their associated data and results. You can use the MLflow UI to easily visualize and compare these runs. To access the MLflow UI, you can typically run the following command:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then, you can open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL to explore your experiment runs visually.
